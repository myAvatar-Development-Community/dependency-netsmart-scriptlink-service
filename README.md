# Netsmart ScriptLink Service

myAvatarâ„¢ web services - both Netsmart and custom - require the "Netsmart ScriptLink Service" component to function.

Ideally you would download the current version of the Scriptlink Service from the Netsmart Community App Exchange (but as of May 2022) the App Exchange is not available.

So the next best option is to download the Netsmart ScriptLink Service from this repository [here](136_4354_20_ScriptLinkStub.zip).

This is the latest version of the Scriptlink Service, downloaded from the App Exchange prior to the Service Now update.

Please verify that the file you downloaded matches the following information:
